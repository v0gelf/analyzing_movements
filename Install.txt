It is recommend to use Anaconda for Python: https://www.anaconda.com/

Note: This code was established and executed using Windows. It might be the case that you have to
adapt it if you prefer to use other operating systems.

Required libraries: eval_base_study.py and eval_validation_study.py need

- Tensorflow
- Scikit-learn

to be installed. 
1. Please create a new conda environment using
	conda create --name myenv
   where - myenv - is replaced by your name of choice. 

2. Activate the environment by calling 
	conda activate myenv

3. Afterward, install Tensorflow by calling
	conda install tensorflow
   or see https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/tensorflow/for installation options.
   Similarly, install Scikit-learn by calling
	conda install scikit-learn


For example plots, as in data_plot.py, lda_svm_plot.py, segments_plot.py, whole_sessions_plot.py, install similarly

-Matplotlib
-Pydotplus
-Pandas
-Seaborn

in the same environment.

Note: For our investigations, we used Tensorflow 2.3. It might be the case that you have to adapt the code, if you 
prefer to choose another version.
